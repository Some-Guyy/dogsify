This web application was done as a mini project when I was learning about Tensorflow and Keras. It processes your images via a machine learning model and predicts a dog breed from the image. 

The model was trained via transfer learning from mobilenet. Credits for the data set and more are located in the website's footer. [Visit the website now!](http://dogsify.herokuapp.com/ "Dogsify")
