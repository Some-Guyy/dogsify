This web application was done as a mini project when I was learning about [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). It processes your images via a machine learning model and predicts a dog breed from the image. 

The model was trained using the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset) via transfer learning from [MobileNet](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/).
